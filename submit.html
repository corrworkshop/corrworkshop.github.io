  <p><b><mark>Call for Papers</mark></b>
    We are sourcing two different types of papers: four-page papers and one-page abstracts, focusing on structured and causal representations and their applications in robotics. Specific topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Causal representation learning: how to learn representations with deep networks that conform to cause-and-effect transformations in the pixel space.</li>
      <li>Object-centric learning: how to learn representations that are object-specific without requiring closed-world manual annotations.</li>
      <li>Scaling structured representations: how to learn object-centric learning and causal representations on real-world image and video data such as MS COCO images or videos from YouTube</li>
      <li>Downstream applications of structured representations: how to use causal and object-centric representations for tasks such as reinforcement learning, planning, and decision-making.</li>
      <li>Learning of interventions: how can a robot algorithm transform and control different components of the environment to achieve certain goals.</li>
      <li>Causal Reinforcement Learning for Embodied AI: how to best learn RL policies to achieve goals if cause-and-effect relations are known.</li>
      <li>Benchmarks that quantify the benefits of causal and object-centric representations (e.g. systematic generalization, OOD performance, robustness wrt. interventions, etc.). </li>
      <li>Relations and possible synergies to foundation models.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b> Submission Policy: </b></p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage two types of submissions: 
      <ol>
        <li><em>Novel Papers:</em> 4-page submissions presenting new perspectives or experimental results. Should contain up to 4 pages of main paper plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material</li>
        <li><em>Abstracts from previously published work:</em> One-page abstracts of previously submitted work (e.g., from CVPR or in other related conferences). The single page should contain a summary of the paper and outline its relation to the workshop topic and a note on where the paper was presented earlier.</li>
      </ol>
    <li>We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. We reserve the right to desk reject papers that strongly violate this format (e.g., more than 4 pages of main content before references)</li>
    <li>Submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.</li>
    <li>Papers should use <a href="https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit">this style template</a>.</li>
    <li>Accepted submissions will appear on the workshop website (non-archival).</li>
  </ul>
