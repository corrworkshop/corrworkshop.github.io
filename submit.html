  <p><b><mark>Call for Papers</mark></b>
    We are sourcing two different type of papers four-page papers and one-page abstracts focusing on structured and causal representations and their applications in robotics. Specific topics of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li>Causal representation learning: how to learn representations with deep networks that conform to cause-and-effect transformations in the pixel space,</li>
      <li>Object-centric learning: how to learn representations that are object-specific without requiring closed-world manual annotations</li>
      <li>Scaling stuctured representations: how to learn object-centric learning and causal represenations on real-world image and video datasets such MS COCO images or videos from YouTube.</li>
      <li>Downstream applications of structured representations: how to use causal and object-centric representations for tasks such as reinforcement learning, planning, and decision making.</li>
      <li>Learning of interventions: how can a robot algorithm can transform and control diffent components of the environment to achieve certain goals.</li>
      <li>Causal reinforcement for Embodied AI: how to best learn RL policies to achieve goals if we know cause-and-effects relations are known.</li>
      <li>Benchmarks that quantify the benefits of causal and object-centric representations (e.g. systematic generalization, OOD performance, robustness wrt. interventions, etc.) </li>
      <li>Relations and possible synergies to foundation models</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p><b> Submission Policy: </b></p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>We encourage two types of submissions: 4 page submissions for novel papers as well one-page abstracts of previosly submitted work (e.g. from CVPR or in other related conferences). 
      
    <li>4 page paper submissions should contain up to 4 pages of main paper plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. We reserve the right to desk reject papers that strongly violate this format (e.g. more than 4 pages main content before references)</li>
    <li>Submissions should be fully anonymized for double-blind review.</li>
    <li>Papers should use <a href="https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit">this style template</a>.</li>
    <li>Accepted submissions will appear on the workshop website (non-archival).</li>
  </ul>
