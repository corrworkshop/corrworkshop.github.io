  Current approaches in computer vision and machine learning largely depend on identifying statistical correlations within massive datasets, which limits their capability in areas requiring higher-order cognition such as domain generalization and planning. Causal Representation Learning offers a promising solution by integrating causality principles to enable models to understand cause-and-effect relationships, thereby producing object-centric and controllable representations. This method aims to overcome the challenges posed by conventional models that rely solely on correlations, offering a new pathway for advancing computer vision, particularly in dynamic and complex environments like robotics. Despite its potential, integrating causal mechanisms into computer vision and embodied AI systems remains complex, with significant challenges in modeling interventions and learning autonomously from simulations.

<p>
  This workshop aims to bring together researchers from structured (object-centric and causal) representation learning and robotics-oriented computer vision. To help integrate ideas from these areas, we invite researchers that want from Embodied AI, Causality and Representation Learning. We hope that this creates opportunities for disscusion, presenting cutting-edge research, establishing new collaborations and identifying future research directions.
</p>
<p>
  In particular, we welcome contributions in the direction of:
  <ul>
    <li>Causal representation learning: how to learn representations with deep networks that conform to cause-and-effect transformations in the pixel space,</li>
    <li>Object-centric learning: how to learn representations that are object-specific without requiring closed-world manual annotations</li>
    <li>Scaling stuctured representations: how to learn object-centric learning and causal represenations on real-world image and video datasets such MS COCO images or videos from YouTube.</li>
    <li>Downstream applications of structured representations: how to use causal and object-centric representations for tasks such as reinforcement learning, planning, and decision making.</li>
    <li>Learning of interventions: how can a robot algorithm can transform and control diffent components of the environment to achieve certain goals.</li>
    <li>Causal reinforcement for Embodied AI: how to best learn RL policies to achieve goals if we know cause-and-effects relations are known.</li>
    <li>Benchmarks that quantify the benefits of causal and object-centric representations (e.g. systematic generalization, OOD performance, robustness wrt. interventions, etc.) </li>
    <li>Relations and possible synergies to foundation models</li>
  </ul>
